# workloads

Kuberenetes workloads are each installed via a separate Pulumi chart. Automation takes care of all the business normally, but this provides an easy and standardized process for creating new workloads and troubleshooting.

Each subdirectory follows a `###-workload-name` pattern, with space left between the digits so workloads can be introduced along the way, as needed.
